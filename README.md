# file-viewer2 (archived)

> **Status:** This experimental Slint port has been superseded by the
> actively maintained repository
> [DaQue/gemini-file-viewer-linux-enhanced-ui-features](https://github.com/DaQue/gemini-file-viewer-linux-enhanced-ui-features).
> Future updates, releases, and issue tracking happen there.

Historical note: file-viewer2 was a short-lived attempt to port the project
from egui/eframe to Slint for evaluation.
